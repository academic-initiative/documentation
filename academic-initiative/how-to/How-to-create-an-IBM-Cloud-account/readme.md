## Troubleshooting

Q: I received an error message with code when applying the IBM Cloud Feature Code.  What should I do?
<br />
A: Please contact the code provider for assistance.  You will most likely need a replacement code.
<br />
<br />
Q: While registering for an IBM Cloud account I provided a credit card.  Can I undo this?
<br />
A: No, entering a credit card creates a Pay-As-You-Go account and enables you to use both free and paid services. This cannot be undone.  Any charges from paid services will be billed to the credit card on file. We recommend setting up [spending notifications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-spending) to help avoid unwanted charges.
<br />
<br />
Q: My IBM Cloud trial account has expired and is now asking me to upgrade and provide a credit card.  What are my options?
<br />
A: You may [upgrade your account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-upgrading-account) to reactivate and continue using your existing account or create a brand new account using a new email address.
